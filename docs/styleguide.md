The design choices were made to fulfill the following requirements:
- Fit seamlessly with University of Wisconsin's aesthetics (available at [UW's Brand and Visual Identity](https://brand.wisc.edu/));
- Follow design good practices in User Experience and Accessibility;
- Adapt to both large and small screens.

headers. |
Verlag Bold Italic 
700
Same as Verlag Bold above, italicized.
Verlag Black 
800
All caps for headers, often in conjunction with the 
red mini bar. Verlag Black should not appear in 
title case or sentence case.
Vitesse                   
400
An accent font, to be used sparingly. Possible 
usages: call-out boxes to highlight statistics, as a 
unique subhead on a page, and for pull quotes.

Verlag Book for long body cop
