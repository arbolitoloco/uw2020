# Symbiota Installation
Following instructions found at [Symbiota's documentation](symbiota.org/docs/installation-instructions/) and some trial and error, this is the step-by-step to install a Symbiota portal:
1. Prototype development started with [Symbiota version 1.0](https://github.com/Symbiota/Symbiota/releases) (cloned from Github 2018-05-11)
2. Created MySQL database
3. Added reader and writer users to database
4. Imported schema update files to database from /config/schema-1.0
5. Edited /config/dbconnection.php with database credentials
6. Edited /config/symbini.php with general configurations, had issues with relative paths - fixed (pay attention to $CLIENT_ROOT path)
7. Server admin granted user privileges
8. First empty portal successfully running!
