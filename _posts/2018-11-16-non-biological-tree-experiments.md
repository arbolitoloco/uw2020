Collections hosted at the Geological Museum and the Anthropology Department need a workaround to be incorporated in Symbiota. The workaround consists in creating a non-biological taxonomic tree where the "taxa" have to reflect some sort of classification used for non-biological specimens, such as rocks, fossils, minerals, and artifacts.

## Geology trees

The Geological Museum's specimens are hosted in three main collections: Vertebrates, Invertebrates, and Minerals. While the first two can be accommodated in the main Animalia tree, the Minerals need a custom tree. An analysis of the mineral specimen records returns 16 preliminary "taxa" (column `OBJNAME`):
